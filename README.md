Twiliio SMS Broadcasting POC
============================

GroupMe bot to listen to a chat(s) and text messages to all registered phone
numbers when prompted.

This is not super polished, just a Proof of Concept for now, might improve on
it later.

Usage:

1. Install dependencies
   ```
   $ pip install twilio
   ```

2. Update files
    * Add twilio sid, api key, and phone number to twilio.txt
    * Add phone numbers to text to numbers.txt
    * Add server address and port to server.txt

3. Register bot in groupme. You're on your own for this, use a guide or ask a friend.
Basically you just need to register your bot's address (and port) for a group.
